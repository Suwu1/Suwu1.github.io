<h1>Are We Smart Enough <br>to Know How Smart Animals Are? <br>
by Frans de Waal – review</h1>

<h2>Virtually every ‘uniquely human’ characteristic has turned out not to be so. <br>This engaging study has the latest thinking on the intelligence of humans and other animals</h2>

  <p>In 1747 the French doctor and philosopher Julien Offray de La Mettrie suggested we might, using sign language, teach great apes to speak. He justified this proposal by stating that from “animals to man there is no abrupt transition … What was man before he invented words and learnt languages? An animal of a particular species.” In his fine book, the Dutch-American primatologist Frans de Waal pursues this line of thinking, not so much to see if apes can use language (they can, although only at a very low level), but to show that there is no clear behavioural division between ourselves and other animals.</p>
<br>
  <p>Virtually every characteristic that has been claimed to be uniquely human has eventually turned out to have some kind of a precursor in a close relative. As De Waal explains in a series of engaging accounts, language, self-recognition, tool making, empathy, co-operative behaviour, mental time-travel, culture and many other traits and abilities have turned out not to be exclusively human. This is hardly surprising, given that we evolved from an ape ancestor not so long ago: we share behaviour with our relatives, just as we share</p>
  <br>
  <p>De Waal is not interested in showing what animals cannot do, but rather what they can do, and clarifying why. He has made a video, as part of a TED talk, in which a pair of capuchin monkeys in adjoining cages each offer a human a token in return for a piece of fruit. One monkey gets a much-desired grape in return for their “work”; the other gets a piece of cucumber, which capuchins are not so impressed by. The monkey that gets the cucumber looks across at the other monkey and its grape, apparently becomes outraged, throws the cucumber at the experimenter and shakes the bars of its cage with frustration.</p>

<h4>
  <p>To understand why animals – and humans – behave the way they do, we need to look at their natural history. In his opening section, De Waal highlights the work of the early 20th-century German biologist Jakob von Uexküll, who argued that, before we can correctly interpret the behaviour of an animal, we need to understand the animal’s Umwelt, or “surrounding world”. For Uexküll, and for De Waal, ecology explains everything – it includes not only the physical environment, but also the animal’s sensory and social worlds. Humans, capuchins and many other primates are inequality averse because their social systems are built on reciprocity. This in turn can be explained by the particular ecology the species evolved in, and the existence of genes that, in unknown and complex ways, produce the structures and chemicals that enable these social behaviours to occur.</p>
<br>
<p>De Waal does not explore the underlying processes producing the complex and intriguing behaviours described here: we know very little about them. Instead, he focuses on observations and behavioural experiments from the growing field of evolutionary cognition. These allow us to peer into the minds of non-human animals – mainly social animals such as primates and corvids (crows and their relatives), but also dolphins, elephants and one invertebrate, which differs from the others not only in its anatomy but also in its solitary behaviour: the octopus.</p>
<br>
<p>De Waal’s holistic and empathetic approach to animals contrasts starkly with the arid dead end of BF Skinner’s behaviourism, which dominated studies of animal behaviour in the second half of the 20th century and banished all talk of feelings or mind, looking instead at learned behavioural responses.
</p>
<br>
<p>Despite his hostility to Skinner, De Waal slices through overcomplex explanations of animal behaviour – he describes how various animals respond appropriately to quite detailed sentences spoken by keepers or experimenters, but argues that they probably did not understand the exact words, but instead interpreted vocal tone, body language and gestures. Being confident as to when to embrace a more complex description of animal behaviour is clearly something of an art.</p>

<h5>
  <p>One aspect of behaviour not dealt with in the book, and which for the moment does remain uniquely human, is teaching. To impart knowledge involves realising what someone else does not know and working out how to get them to understand it. All tool making and culture in animals seems so far to involve observational learning, not active teaching. The lesson of De Waal’s book, however, is that something like teaching will eventually be seen in our ape cousins.</p>
<br>
<p>He skirts around the central question that many readers will be most intrigued by – the nature of consciousness, and its potential existence in non-human animals. His explanation for this approach is simple: he is not sure what consciousness is (no one is), and so it is hard to see how to study it or to devise an experiment that could test for its presence.</p>
<br>
<p>The best proxy we have for consciousness is the mirror self-recognition test: this involves getting an animal used to a mirror and then putting a mark somewhere on its body where it cannot be seen directly. If the animal shows behaviour directed towards the hidden mark when it is looking in the mirror, then it has passed the test. But what that implies is unclear.
<br>
<p>The list of animals that can pass this test is very short: humans, chimps, bonobos, gorillas (though they really do not like the eye contact the mirror involves), orangutans, dolphins, an Indian elephant called Happy (African elephants are hard to study as they tend to smash up the mirror), and a particularly smart magpie called Gertie. As well as touching artificial marks, these animals will also use the mirror outside of the experiment, to inspect body parts they cannot normally see – the inside of their mouths, or their backsides. They clearly know what they are doing.</p>
<br>
<p>When I was growing up, aspiring naturalists or behavioural scientists would be given a copy of Konrad Lorenz’s zoological investigation King Solomon’s Ring to inspire them. With its wide-ranging and thought-provoking content, Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? is an appropriate 21st-century replacement. If you are at all interested in what it is to be an animal, human or otherwise, you should read this book.</p>
